:summary: Introductory video to the `BEAT Platform`_ for `Open Science`_ and
          `Reproducible Research`


The BEAT platform is a European computing e-infrastructure for `Open Science`_
proposing a solution for open access, scientific information sharing and re-use
including data and source code while protecting privacy and confidentiality. It
allows easy online access to experimentation and testing in computational
science. You define what data and modules you would like to use, we make sure
the system runs and provides you with a result. Data from different experiments
can be easily compared and searched. The platform also provides an attestation
mechanism for your reports (scientific papers, technical documents or
certifications). I am one of the authors and architect of the platform. I
coordinate work on it at the `Idiap Research Institute`_.

This video contains a beginners tutorial on some of the BEAT Platform's main
features and concepts. For more information, visit the `BEAT platform`_ website
or get in touch via `our mailing list`_. You can access the video using `this
