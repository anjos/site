    abstract = {Sleep stage classiﬁcation constitutes an important preliminary
                exam in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. It is traditionally
                performed by a sleep expert who assigns to each 30 s of signal a
                sleep stage, based on the visual inspection of signals such as
                electroencephalograms (EEG), electrooculograms (EOG),
                electrocardiograms (ECG) and electromyograms (EMG). We introduce
                here the ﬁrst deep learning approach for sleep stage
                classiﬁcation that learns end-to-end without computing
                spectrograms or extracting hand-crafted features, that exploits
                all multivariate and multimodal Polysomnography (PSG) signals
                (EEG, EMG and EOG), and that can exploit the temporal context of
                each 30 s window of data. For each modality the ﬁrst layer learns
                linear spatial ﬁlters that exploit the array of sensors to
                increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and the last layer feeds the
                learnt representation to a softmax classiﬁer. Our model is
                compared to alternative automatic approaches based on
                convolutional networks or decisions trees. Results obtained on 61
                publicly available PSG records with up to 20 EEG channels
                demonstrate that our network architecture yields state-of-the-art
                performance. Our study reveals a number of insights on the
                spatio-temporal distribution of the signal of interest: a good
                trade-off for optimal classiﬁcation performance measured with
                balanced accuracy is to use 6 EEG with 2 EOG (left and right) and
                3 EMG chin channels. Also exploiting one minute of data before
                and after each data segment offers the strongest improvement when
                a limited number of channels is available. As sleep experts, our
                system exploits the multivariate and multimodal nature of PSG
                signals in order to deliver state-of-the-art classiﬁcation
                performance with a small computational cost.},
