   Visual comparison between Little U-Net model predictions and ground truth
   annotation. (Image): contrast-enhanced image. (Ground truth): ground truth
   segmentation. (Model segmentation): segmentation generated by Little U-Net
   model. (Errors): error image where false positives and false negatives are
   represented in blue and red respectively.

In this thesis, we sought at developing precise neuron segmentation in order to
support future study on the morphological phenotype of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. We tackled this task by developing two different segmentation
pipelines: the first one based on classical image and signal processing, and
the second one based on a fully convolutional neural network architecture,
capitalizing on our first pipeline segmentation's to bypass the need of labeled
training data. We shown that both our method outperformed other segmentation
tools used in the literature and shed light on important requirements for
training neural network on segmentation tasks.
