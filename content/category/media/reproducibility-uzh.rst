:summary: My invited talk at University of Zurich on Reproducible Research
          background, motivations and methodology.


One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of
repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar
conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis, e.g.
bioinformatics or computational biology, have often suffered from incomplete
method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw
data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially
prevents any possibility of attempting to reproduce the results of such
studies. The term “reproducible research” has been used to describe the idea
that a scientific publication based on computational analysis should be
distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the
code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw
data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof.

Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct but also
provides other researchers the access to build upon previous work. Most
importantly, the person setting up a reproducible research project will quickly
realize the immediate personal benefits: an organized and structured way of
working. The person that most often has to reproduce your own analysis is your
future self!

In this talk, I quickly present myself, current work, and go through a
presentation about key motivation factors and issues in building reproducible
code.  I end-up show casing tools, and a strategy for building a reproducible
research ecosystem.
