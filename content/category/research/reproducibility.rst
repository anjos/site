:summary: Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct but
          also provides other researchers the access to build upon previous
          work. Most importantly, the person setting up a reproducible research
          project will quickly realize the immediate personal benefits: an
          organized and structured way of working. The person that most often
          has to reproduce your own analysis is your future self!

One of the key principles of proper scientific procedure is the act of
repeating an experiment or analysis and being able to reach similar
conclusions. Published research based on computational analysis, e.g.
bioinformatics or computational biology, have often suffered from incomplete
method descriptions (e.g. list of used software versions); unavailable raw
data; and incomplete, undocumented and/or unavailable code. This essentially
prevents any possibility of attempting to reproduce the results of such
studies. The term "reproducible research" has been used to describe the idea
that a scientific publication based on computational analysis should be
distributed along with all the raw data and metadata used in the study, all the
code and/or computational notebooks needed to produce results from the raw
data, and the computational environment or a complete description thereof.

Reproducible research not only leads to proper scientific conduct but also
provides other researchers the access to build upon previous work. Most
importantly, the person setting up a reproducible research project will quickly
realize the immediate personal benefits: an organized and structured way of
working. The person that most often has to reproduce your own analysis is your
future self!

All our work is driven by fully reproducible framework.  More recently, we have
been actively looking at the reproducibility of published work and how to lower
the entrance barrier of publication readers.  We argue it is insufficient, in
most cases, to only publish software leading to results if original data
remains inaccessible.  Reproducibility should imply in the following
characteristics: repeatability, share-ability, extensibility and stability,
which is not guaranteed by most published material to date [@@icml-2017-2].  We
propose a software suite called Bob_ that possesses these characteristics,
demonstrating its flexibility to various tasks including Medical Image
Segmentation, Biometric Person Recognition, Presentation Attack Detection, and
Remote Photoplethysmography.

From another perspective, there are legitimate cases in which raw data leading
to research conclusions cannot be published.  Furthermore, in a growing number
of use-cases, the availability of both software does not translate to an
accessible reproducibility scenario.  To bridge this gap, we built an open
platform for research called BEAT_ [@@icml-2017-1] in computational sciences
related to pattern recognition and machine learning, to help on the
development, reproducibility and certification of results obtained in the
field.

Bob_ and BEAT_ are still active and support past and future work at Idiap and
beyond.  We also conduct lectures to both master and graduate students about
reproducibility in data science.
