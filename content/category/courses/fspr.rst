This course (`EE-612`_) presents fundamental tools used in Machine Learning and
Pattern Recognition ranging from the most basic to more advanced (e.g. Logistic
Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Deep Learning, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Super
Vector Machines). This course can serve as a pre-requisite for more advanced
course on Machine Learning. It is given to post-grad (Ph.D.) students at the
`École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne`_, Switzerland.

Outcomes: this course provides in-depth understanding in Machine Learning as
well as concrete tools to PhD students for their work.  This course could serve
as a pre-requisite for more advanced courses such as Machine Learning,
Graphical Models, Statistical Sequence Processing and Computational perception
using multimodal sensors.
