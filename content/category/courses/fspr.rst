This course (`EE-612`_) presents fundamental tools used in statistical pattern
recognition ranging from the most basic to more advanced (e.g. Logistic
Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models and
Super Vector Machines). This course can serve as a pre-requisite for more
advanced course on Machine Learning. It is given to post-grad (Ph.D.) students
at the `École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne`_, Switzerland.

Outcomes: this course provides in-depth understanding in Statistical Pattern
Recognition as well as concrete tools to PhD students for their work. This
course could serve as a pre-requisite for more advanced courses such as Machine
Learning, Graphical Models, Statistical Sequence Processing and Computational
perception using multimodal sensors.

*Keywords*: Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Linear models, PCA, LDA,
MLP, SVM, GMM, HMM.

Program:

* **Lectures**: 32 hours (8 lectures)
* **Labs**: 24 hours (5 labs)
* **Grading**: Lab assignments (35%) and Final project (65%)
* **Days**: Thursdays, from 9:15 to 13:00 with a break in the middle

Required prior knowledge: Linear algebra, Probabilities and Statistics, Signal
Processing, Python Programming

**Resources**: In general the slides of a lecture are available after the
lecture (later in the day), while the lab material is available 1 week before
the lecture (early morning), through our `Moodle page`_.
