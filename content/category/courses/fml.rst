:summary: This course, divided in two trimesters (modules M06 and M08),
          presents fundamental tools used in machine learning ranging from the
          most basic to more advanced. It is given to master students at the
          `Master in AI`_ by the Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland.

This course, divided in two trimesters (modules M06 and M08), present
fundamental tools used in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition ranging from
the most basic to more advanced (e.g. Logistic Regression, Principal Component
Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Gaussian
Mixture Models, and Super Vector Machines). This course serves as a
pre-requisite for Deep Learning and other master specialisations. It is given
to master students at Idiap's `Master in AI`_.


**Program**:

* **Credits**: 4 ECTS_ (equivalent to 100 to 120 working hours)
* **Grading**: Lab assignments (50%) and Final exam (50%)
* **Days**: Tuesdays, from 9:00 to 10:30
* Required prior knowledge: Linear algebra, Probabilities and Statistics,
  Python Programming
* Syllabus:

  * Linear Regression (week 1 and 2)
  * Logistic Regression (week 3 and 4)
  * Decision Trees (week 5 and 6)
  * Boosting (week 7 and 8)
  * Multi-layer perceptron (week 9 and 10)
  * Final Exam (week 11)
* Structure:

  Each topic is approached in two activities, where the first one covers
  theoretical content about one particular topic and the second one discusses
  practical aspects, as well as the assignments of the corresponding topic.

  Between each theoretical and practical activities a mandatory assignment is
  provided. Such assignment contains practical exercises (to be implemented in
  Python) about the corresponding theoretical class.  The student has five days
  in general to deliver such assignment but the specific deadlines are provided
  for each practical exercise hereafter.


**Resources**:

* `Moodle page`_: contains slides for all courses and lab assignments
  (N.B.: enrollement required)
* JupyterHub_: Course assignments are provided as `Jupyter Notebooks`_ through
  JupyterHub_ (no software installation required on student laptop)
