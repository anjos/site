After 4 years of development, the `BEAT platform`_ is now available for
download as an open-source project, under the Affero GNU GPL version 3. It is
composed of a few packages which can be reached on this `gitlab group
repository`, hosted at Idiap.

The BEAT platform is a European computing e-infrastructure for `Open Science`_
proposing a solution for open access, scientific information sharing and re-use
including data and source code while protecting privacy and confidentiality. It
allows easy online access to experimentation and testing in computational
science. You define what data and modules you would like to use, we make sure
the system runs and provides you with a result. Data from different experiments
can be easily compared and searched. The platform also provides an attestation
mechanism for your reports (scientific papers, technical documents or
certifications). I am one of the authors and architect of the platform. I
coordinate work on it at the `Idiap Research Institute`_.
