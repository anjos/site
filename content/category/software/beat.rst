The `BEAT platform`_ is a European computing e-infrastructure for `Open
Science`_ proposing a solution for open access, scientific information sharing
and re-use including data and source code while protecting privacy and
confidentiality. It allows easy online access to experimentation and testing in
computational science. You define what data and modules you would like to use,
we make sure the system runs and provides you with a result. Data from
different experiments can be easily compared and searched. The platform also
provides an attestation mechanism for your reports (scientific papers,
technical documents or certifications). I am one of the authors and architect
of the platform. I coordinate work on it at the `Idiap Research Institute`_.
