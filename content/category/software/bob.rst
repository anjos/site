Bob_ is a signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally developed
by the `Biometrics Security and Privacy Group`_, the `Medical AI Group`_, and
the `Research and Development Engineers Group`_ at the `Idiap Research
Institute`_, in Switzerland.  Bob is primarily developed through GitLab_.

The framework is composed of various packages for signal, audio and video
processing, object detection, keypoint localization, machine learning and
analysis. A set of database interfaces allow the creation of programmatic
pipelines for describing experiments in machine learning.

I'm one of the authors of this toolkit, which is used by our groups in
producing high-quality `reproducible research`_ papers.
