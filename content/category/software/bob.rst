Bob_ is a signal-processing and machine learning toolbox originally developed
by the Biometrics Group at the `Idiap Research Institute`_, in Switzerland.

The framework is composed of various packages for signal, audio and video
processing, object detection, keypoint localization, machine learning and
analysis. A set of database interfaces allow the creation of programmatic
pipelines for describing experiments in data science.

I'm one of the authors of this toolkit, which is used by our group in producing
high-quality `reproducible research`_ papers.
