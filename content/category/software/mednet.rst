:summary: Mednet_ is disease classification and grading library for medical
          imaging based on PyTorch_.

Mednet_ is an open-source software package that can train and evaluate
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to detect and grade diseases
based on medical images. Examples include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) detection
based on chest X-rays (CXR) and Inflammatory Eye-Diseases based on fundus
angiograms.
