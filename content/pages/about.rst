   Taken at the Idiap Research Institute, August 19th., 2010. At the photo we
   also find Sébastien Marcel (our group leader, standing) and Laurent
   El-Shafey (on the computer).


My name is André (Rabello dos) Anjos. I presently work for the `Idiap Research
Institute`_ located in the nice town of Martigny, Wallis, Switzerland. Here, I
conduct research in Biometrics (with applications to Face Recognition). My main
research interests are Machine Learning, Pattern Classification, Face
Recognition, Security and Computing. Previously, I used to work for the
`University of Wisconsin, Madison`_, USA at `CERN`_, Switzerland, as a Software
Engineer for at the `ATLAS experiment`_. During that time, I was one of the
responsibles for the development and maintenance the experiment's Trigger and
Data-Acquisition system.

   This photo was taken during the start-up of LHC activities at the ATLAS
   Control Room, September 10th., 2008.


I started studying electronics and computers in 1994, when I joined the
Electronics Engineering School of the `Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro`_. I finished my basic electronic engineering studies in 1999, my
masters degree in 2001, finally getting a Ph.D. in Signal Processing in 2006.
During this time I have been affiliated to the `Signal Processing Laboratory`_.
I have studied different subjects during all these years ranging from digital
filters to pattern recognition. Most of my research time during school years
was dedicated to `Artificial Neural Networks`_. I keep a record of all my
`publications`_ in this website.

   Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation, H.E. Mr. Ronaldo Mota
   Sardenberg, at CERN, July 23rd., 2002.


Programming for me debutted in 1994, when I joined the university. I really
love programming and spend large parts of my work time and a smaller fraction
of my free time doing this. I enjoy simplicity and powerful designs. It is
difficult to make something simple. It is far easier to design a complicated
unmaintainable solution.

You can access my `CV`_ here. If you are interested in code, you can check-out
my contributions on `github`_ or `gitlab`_. Publications are available on my
`publications`_ link. Specifically, if you wonder how `this website`_ is
hacked together, you should take a look at that link.
