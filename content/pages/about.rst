:summary: Some information about me

My name is André (Rabello dos) Anjos. I'm Scientific Researcher at the `Idiap
Research Institute`_ located in the nice town of Martigny, Wallis, Switzerland.
Here, I conduct `Reproducible Research`_ in Computer Vision and Machine
Learning applied to medical data.  My other research interests are Biometrics,
Pattern Classification, Signal Processing, and Computing.  Previously, I used to
work for the `University of Wisconsin, Madison`_, USA at `CERN`_, Switzerland,
as a Software Engineer for at the `ATLAS experiment`_. During that time, I was
one of the responsibles for the development and maintenance the experiment's
Trigger and Data-Acquisition system.

I started studying electronics and computers in 1994, when I joined the
Electronics Engineering School of the `Federal University of Rio de Janeiro`_.
I finished my basic electronic engineering studies in 1999, my masters degree
in 2001, finally getting a Ph.D. in Signal Processing in 2006. During this time
I have been affiliated to the `Signal Processing Laboratory`_. I have studied
different subjects during all these years ranging from digital filters to
pattern recognition. Most of my research time during school years was dedicated
to `Artificial Neural Networks`_.  I keep a record of all my `publications`_ in
this website.

I'm a scientific researcher who is also passionate about software.  Such a
passion started around 1994, when I first joined the engineering school. I
enjoy simplicity and powerful designs.  I find it is quite hard to make
something simple and strive to reach this goal in everything I do.

You can access my `CV`_ here. If you are interested in code, you can check-out
my contributions on `github`_ or `gitlab`_. Publications are available on my
`publications`_ link. Specifically, if you wonder how `this website`_ was put
together, you should take a look at that link.
