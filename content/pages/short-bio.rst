:summary: Short biography, for all purposes

André Anjos received his Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the `Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro`_ in 2006. He joined the `ATLAS Experiment`_ at
European Centre for Particle Physics (CERN_, Switzerland) from 2001 until 2010
where he worked in the development and deployment of the Trigger and Data
Acquisition systems that are nowadays powering the discovery of the Higgs
boson. During his time at CERN_, André studied the application of neural
networks and statistical methods for particle recognition at the trigger level
and developed several software components still in use today. In 2010, André
joined the `Biometrics Security and Privacy Group`_ at the `Idiap Research
Institute` where he worked with face and vein biometrics, presentation attack
detection, and reproducibility in research.  Since 2018 André heads the
`Biosignal Processing Group`_ at Idiap_.  His current research interests
include medical applications, biometrics, image and signal processing, machine
learning, research reproducibility and open science. Among André's open-source
contributions, one can cite Bob_ and the the BEAT_ framework for evaluation and
testing of machine learning systems. He teaches graduate-level `machine
learning courses`_ at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL_) and
master courses at Idiap's `Master of AI`_.  He serves as reviewer for various
scientific journals in pattern recognition, machine learning, and image.


Shorter Version
===============

*(if you must)*

André Anjos received his Ph.D. degree in signal processing in 2006 studying the
application of neural nets and statistical methods for particle recognition in
the context of High-Energy Physics experiments at Large Hadron Collider at
CERN_, Switzerland. He joined the `Idiap Research Institute`_ in 2010 where he
works with biosignal processing and biometrics applications. He currently heads
the `Biosignal Processing Group`_ at Idiap_. Current interests include
reproducible research and open-science for medical applications, biometrics,
image and signal processing, and machine learning.  André teaches
graduate-level `machine learning courses`_ at the École Polytechnique Fédérale
de Lausanne (EPFL_) and Idiap's `Master of AI`_ and serves as reviewer for
various scientific journals in pattern recognition, image processing and
biometrics.
