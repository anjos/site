:summary: Short biography, for all purposes

André Anjos holds a Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the `Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro`_ (2006). He spent nearly a decade (2001-2010) at CERN_'s `ATLAS Experiment`_,
where he played a key role in developing and deploying the Trigger and Data Acquisition
systems that have enabled groundbreaking discoveries, including the Higgs boson. During
this period, André explored the application of neural networks and statistical methods
to particle recognition, contributing several software components that remain in use
today. In 2010, André joined the `Biometrics Security and Privacy Group`_ at the `Idiap
Research Institute` where he focused on face and vein biometrics, and presentation
attack detection, with a keen interest in reproducibility and open sciences. Since 2018
André leads the `Medical AI Group`_ (MedAI) at Idiap_, investigating medical
applications, image and signal processing, machine learning, research reproducibility
and open science. Among André's open-source contributions, one can cite Mednet_ and the
BEAT_ framework for evaluation and testing of machine learning systems. He teaches
graduate-level `machine learning courses`_ at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL_), and Idiap's `Master of AI`_. He serves as reviewer for various
scientific journals in pattern recognition, machine learning, and image processing.


Shorter Version
===============

*(if you must)*

André Anjos holds a Ph.D. degree in signal processing and machine learning (2006)
studying the application of neural nets and statistical methods for particle recognition
in the context of High-Energy Physics experiments at Large Hadron Collider at CERN_,
Switzerland. He joined the `Idiap Research Institute`_ in 2010 where he focused on
biometrics applications. Nowadays, André leads the `Medical AI Group`_ at Idiap_.
Current interests include medical decision making, image and signal processing, machine
learning, research reproducibility and open science. André teaches graduate-level
`machine learning courses`_ at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL_),
Idiap's `Master of AI`_ and serves as reviewer for various scientific journals in
pattern recognition, image processing and biometrics.


.. Opinion-oriented
.. ================
..
.. As a researcher with a Ph.D. in signal processing from the Federal University of Rio de
.. Janeiro (2006), I've had the privilege of working on some of the most cutting-edge
.. projects in science, including the ATLAS Experiment at CERN, where I helped develop and
.. deploy systems that enabled groundbreaking discoveries like the Higgs boson. Since then,
.. my focus has shifted to applying machine learning and data analysis to real-world
.. problems, first in biometrics security and now in medical decision making leading Idiap
.. Research Institute's Medical AI Group. As a pioneer in open-source contributions to
.. machine learning, I've developed tools that are helping to democratize access to these
.. technologies and promote reproducibility and transparency in scientific research –
.. values I believe are essential for driving innovation and progress in our increasingly
.. complex world.
